Model Description:
The CNN model implemented in this repository is designed to classify images into multiple categories or classes. It consists of several 
convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. The model learns hierarchical representations of images through the 
convolutional layers and makes predictions based on these learned features.

WebApp Description
The webapp takes an image as input and distinguishes if the given image is cancerous or non cancerous.
